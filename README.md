# Simulators
Here is a group of simulators.<br>

<h2>1. Projectile Motion Simulation</h2>
Drawn from basic physics projectile motions.<br>
Contains File: ProjectileMotion.java

<h2>2. DFS & BFS Maze Solving Simulation</h2>
Visually observe how DFS & BFS work.<br>
Contains File: DFSBFSVisualizer.java *.mz

<h2>3. The ultimatum Route Simulator</h2>
Visually see how different algorithms work on finding the shortest path between two points.<br>
Contains File: RouteSimulators.java *.tsv<br>
