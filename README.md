# Simulators
Here is a group of simulators just for fun.

1. Projectile Motion Simulation
Drawn from basic physics projectile motions.
Contains File: ProjectileMotion.java

2. DFS & BFS Maze Solving Simulation
Visually observe how DFS & BFS work.
Contains File: DFSBFSVisualizer.java *.mz

3. The ultimatum Route Simulator
Visually see how different algorithms work on finding the shortest path from two points.
Contains File: RouteSimulators.java *.tsv
